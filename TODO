- reload + renderall crashes!
    run valgrind, maybe it will find something
    ...nope, it's happening in SDL dynamic lib somewhere...

- prismelrenderer_parse.c:
    fus_lexer_get_{prismel,rendergraph,mapper} shouldn't take a "name" param?
    Maybe reintroduce the *_map objects?
    No: introduce "variable" objects.
    They don't own their shape/prismel/mapper, and the latter don't have names.
    ^... YES THIS

hexmap_submap_t: if these don't share collmaps, just modify collmaps'
    ox, oy instead of messing around with submap's pos?..

COLLMAP INDICES NEED TO USE SAME Y COORDS AS TRF_T
    (currently they are vertically flipped and it ruins everything)

### prismelmappers whose rgraphs have n_frames > 1 ###

It seems obvious that the resulting n_frames should be the product of mapper & mappee shapes.
...we could make it an attribute of prismelmapper: how to treat animation.
    Options:
        - mapper's animation happens once per frame of mappee's animation
        - mappee's animation happens once per frame of mapper's animation
        - mapper + mappee animate simultaneously  <-- this is the default, cos its easiest?..
...ah, but "mapper" is not a rendergraph, it's a mapper.
We could define mapper's n_frames as the LCD of its rendergraphs' n_frames.

mapper l.blu_double: we're expecting to see light-coloured prismels turned to
    white, others turned to light blue.
    But everything is turned to light blue.
    Is that because our double_sq, double_tri are defined with dark blue?
    (performs an experiment) ...YES.
    Well, ok but why?..
    -> because of that recursive step: mappers end up seeing how things
        are composed, it's up to us to make sure they *behave* as if they
        only see the colors in their sub-shapes' rendered bitmaps.
    -> ok, so what's the fix?
        ...idunno, but take a look at that thing in prismelrenderer.c which
        says:
            /* TODO: think about this and make sure it's correct */
        ...it's probably not correct, eh.

        UPDATE: It's not correct. I did abstract algebra at it until
        its incorrectness was proven. T__T

WHAT'S NEEDED FOR A PROPER DEMO:

    - Better camera scrolling / palette transitions.
    - Music + SFX. Almost anything will do for now.
    - Get rid of hexmap "unit": unit starts as (1 0 0 0) and only
        mappers change it.
        Then add a way in the map.fus files to specify mapper cache
        entries, and that's how tilesets with different units can
        co-exist within same worldmap?..
        Not that simple. There are no "vert", "edge" prismels.
        ...although we could add them, I suppose.
        Things get a little annoying, since we have to start adding
        single-"tri" versions of every tile (and player state??),
        and each mapper needs to have solid mappings for prismels
        tri, vert, edge.
        I guess the fus syntax would be:

            shapes:
                "tile1":
                    prismels:
                        # default, one-"tri" version:
                        : "tri" (0 0 0 0) 0 f  2
                        # ...or even have no prismels at all?..
                        # But having one-"tri" versions is maybe nice
                        # for e.g. a minimap
                    mappings:
                        "curvy":
                            # We're now defining the shape which
                            # will be used for map ("curvy") ("tile1")
                            prismels:
                                # etc
                        "double":
                            # ...

    - Title screen. (Maybe allow setting controls, save/load game,
        character select, multiplayer, etc.)
    - Detect player "death", auto respawn them somewhere useful.
        - Bring back "die" state effect?..
        - Can we abuse player->cooldown and have the "jump" state
            trigger death after some amount of time?
            -> I prefer allowing player to respawn whenever they like,
                and also letting them fly off into space as far as they
                "want".
                So, once exploded, dead=true, and a message can show
                at bottom of screen "you died, press 1 to respawn" or
                whatever, but players are free to fly off into space
                and wait for that message, to see if they'll actually
                land on something.
                -> We need a way to display messages in hexgame.



Instead of "import" in .fus files, we should maybe add "require", or anyway
    imports should be idempotent.
So all you do is specify worldmap, and it loads rgraphs as required.

hexcollmap "parts":
    - need to realloc collmap1 as necessary for collmap2 to fit. (in hexcollmap_draw)
    - maybe below "parts" and "collmap" we can have a "draw" section where
        we specify collmap filenames and coordinates.
        It can reuse existing hexcollmap_draw.
        The coordinates can use int_fancy.
        We can add a "randint" thing to int_fancy.
        And then we will have Wilderness.

* Add fus_lexer_cleanup()... need to go add it everywhere T___T

* audiotest REPL: recover from syntax errors plz

* audiotest REPL: push user input onto an array of strings so they can @def

* audiotest REPL: @triangle's "addinc" param needs to avoid the pop!..
    e.g. @triangle: 7500 1000 15000 addinc1(-1)

    -> ok we fixed the pop, but add it back as an operation somehow...
        Like @pop(...) - because sometimes it sounds good! Like a bass kick.
        What are its parameters?..

The end of the "water" section should involve collecting 2 things from
inside/beside the giant bluegreen thing?
And the end of the "wilderness" section should involve collecting 2 things,
one of which you need to sneak by lots of big_rollers, the other you need
to jump along a spread-out path of triangles and parallelograms?
And then there's something else you need to collect from spidertown.
Or you have to bring these things to spidertown.
...?

Something is weird about the "-2+" etc in the following:

    "spit_dead":
        animation: once 12
        shapes:
            : "player_dead_particle" (0 1 3 1) 1 f  0+ (0 6)
            : "player_dead_particle" (0 1 3 1) 3 f -2+ (2 6)
            : "player_dead_particle" (0 1 3 1) 6 f -3+ (3 6)
            : "player_dead_particle" (0 1 3 1) 9 f -5+ (5 6)

...I think those should all either be "0+" or the non-negative versions
of themselves (if you see what I mean).

Actor states should maybe come with a "pos" so we don't have to rely on
the position of the last recording to have played...

Actor recordings: if we get a fus format for ranges of frames, and a
half-decent tool for stepping through a recording (e.g. if player->keymap
>= 0 then the arrow keys control their recording, maybe left/right is
forward/back a frame, up/down jumps to start/end, action pauses/unpauses),
then we could specify on which frames the given rules of an actor state
should be run.

Need that "press '1' to go back..." message ASAP for useability, I believe.

So, current objectives:

    * Smooth scrolling
    * Smooth transition between palettes
        * Right now palettes live on submaps,
          instead should live on hexmap & have names
            * Can we make a generalized key-value storage thing yet?
              Just use void* for goodness' sake
    * Smooth transition between prismelmappers??? ("zoom levels")
    * Display text on screen
    * Improve "actors"...
        * better recording tools
        * actor states have a pos
        * actor states run through ruleset on multiple frames
        * actor variables
