# DEPTHS OF UO


## What is "Depths of Uo"?

A game in development, a kind of puzzly arcadey look at the triangular grid.


## What is "geom2018"?

A graphics library for tesselating the plane with squares & triangles.
The game demo has sprouted from it, and come to overshadow the library...


## How to compile & run the game

``./compile_demo && ./main`` should do the trick (if you have gcc).
You'll need the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) development/runtime libraries for your OS.

Once the game is running, use the arrow keys to move, Escape to quit.

If you die or get stuck, press '1' to respawn at the last save point you touched.
(Save points are the glowing rotating green things.)

Hold shift while pressing '1' to return to the very start of the game.

Press Spacebar to spit harmless balls.
Their only use is to look cool, and help you judge your jumps.
