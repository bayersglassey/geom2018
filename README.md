# GEOM 2018

## What is this

A graphics library dealing with tesselations of the plane.
And a bit of a game demo, a kind of puzzly arcadey look at the triangular grid.

## How to compile & run

``cd c && ./compile_sdl && ./main`` should do the trick (if you have gcc).

Once game is running, use arrow keys to move.
F5 enters/exits debug console.

Not very user-friendly yet, is it? Don't worry, we're getting there.
