# GEOM 2018

## What is this

A graphics library dealing with tesselations of the plane.
And a bit of a game demo, a kind of puzzly arcadey look at the triangular grid.

## How to compile & run

``cd c && ./compile_sdl && ./main`` should do the trick (if you have gcc).

Once it's running, it shows the debug controls on the screen.
It's a kind of console, into which entering ``run`` should run you the game demo.

Not very user-friendly yet, is it? Don't worry, we're getting there.
