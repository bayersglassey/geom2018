# GEOM 2018

## What is this

A graphics library dealing with tesselations of the plane.
And a bit of a game demo, a kind of puzzly arcadey look at the triangular grid.

## How to compile & run

``cd c && ./compile_demo && ./main`` should do the trick (if you have gcc).
You'll need the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) development libraries for your OS.

Once the game is running, use the arrow keys to move.
F5 enters/exits the debug console.

Not very user-friendly yet, is it? Don't worry, we're getting there.
