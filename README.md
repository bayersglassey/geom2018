# GEOM 2018

## What is this

A graphics library dealing with tesselations of the plane.
And a bit of a game demo, a kind of puzzly arcadey look at the triangular grid.

## How to compile & run the game

``./compile_demo && ./main`` should do the trick (if you have gcc).
You'll need the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) development/runtime libraries for your OS.

Once the game is running, use the arrow keys to move, Escape to quit.

If you die or get stuck, press '1' to respawn at the last save point you touched.
(Save points are the glowing rotating green things.)

F5 enters/exits the debug console, if you want to poke around a bit.

Not very user-friendly yet, is it? Don't worry, we're getting there.
