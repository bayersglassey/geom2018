- reload + renderall crashes!
    run valgrind, maybe it will find something
    ...nope, it's happening in SDL dynamic lib somewhere...
- fus_lexer: Leaving closing quote off a string literal doesn't seem
    to cause an issue?..
    (With the console input of main_sdl.c)

- review uses of RLE
    RLEDestFormat - we keep running into undefined reads of these...
    Specifically as a result of SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface...
    Look at SDL source, figure out wtf is going on

    Theory: we can recreate the bug by creating a surface, blitting it onto
    something else, then creating a texture from it.
        ...nope, didn't work :|
