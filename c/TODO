We need:
    - function for rendering a rendergraph to one of its bitmaps
    - function to get or render one of a rendergraph's bitmaps
    - way to specify, each time one rendergraph refers to another, whether
        the referee's bitmap should be used, or just its trf_lists.

Test app:
    - render the dodeca from data/test.fus in middle of screen
