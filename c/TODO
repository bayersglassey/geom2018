- reload + renderall crashes!
    run valgrind, maybe it will find something
    ...nope, it's happening in SDL dynamic lib somewhere...
- fus_lexer: Leaving closing quote off a string literal doesn't seem
    to cause an issue?..
    (With the console input of main_sdl.c)

- review uses of RLE
    RLEDestFormat - we keep running into undefined reads of these...
    Specifically as a result of SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface...
    Look at SDL source, figure out wtf is going on

    Theory: we can recreate the bug by creating a surface, blitting it onto
    something else, then creating a texture from it.
        ...nope, didn't work :|

- double_double_curvy_curvy_dodeca_B:
    I think we expected this to look like double_curvy_curvy_dodeca_B,
    but with "larger prismels" (that is, "double" applied to "curvy_curvy_dodeca_B").
    But instead it looks like... well, anyway it looks like the order that the
    mappers are being applied in is the opposite of what we expected; or at any rate,
    the *associativity* of application is the opposite of what we expected.

- prismelrenderer_parse.c:
    fus_lexer_get_{prismel,rendergraph,mapper} shouldn't take a "name" param?
    Maybe reintroduce the *_map objects?
    No: introduce "variable" objects.
    They don't own their shape/prismel/mapper, and the latter don't have names.
    ^... YES THIS
