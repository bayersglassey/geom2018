- reload + renderall crashes!
    run valgrind, maybe it will find something
    ...nope, it's happening in SDL dynamic lib somewhere...
- fus_lexer: Leaving closing quote off a string literal doesn't seem
    to cause an issue?..
    (With the console input of main_sdl.c)

- review uses of RLE
    RLEDestFormat - we keep running into undefined reads of these...
    Specifically as a result of SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface...
    Look at SDL source, figure out wtf is going on

    Theory: we can recreate the bug by creating a surface, blitting it onto
    something else, then creating a texture from it.
        ...nope, didn't work :|

- prismelrenderer_parse.c:
    fus_lexer_get_{prismel,rendergraph,mapper} shouldn't take a "name" param?
    Maybe reintroduce the *_map objects?
    No: introduce "variable" objects.
    They don't own their shape/prismel/mapper, and the latter don't have names.
    ^... YES THIS

hexmap_submap_t: if these don't share collmaps, just modify collmaps'
    ox, oy instead of messing around with submap's pos?..

COLLMAP INDICES NEED TO USE SAME Y COORDS AS TRF_T
    (currently they are vertically flipped and it ruins everything)

### prismelmappers whose rgraphs have n_frames > 1 ###

It seems obvious that the resulting n_frames should be the product of mapper & mappee shapes.
...we could make it an attribute of prismelmapper: how to treat animation.
    Options:
        - mapper's animation happens once per frame of mappee's animation
        - mappee's animation happens once per frame of mapper's animation
        - mapper + mappee animate simultaneously  <-- this is the default, cos its easiest?..
...ah, but "mapper" is not a rendergraph, it's a mapper.
We could define mapper's n_frames as the LCD of its rendergraphs' n_frames.


Standardize all fus_lexer stuff to leave lexer looking at NEXT UNPARSED TOKEN.

mapper l.blu_double: we're expecting to see light-coloured prismels turned to
    white, others turned to light blue.
    But everything is turned to light blue.
    Is that because our double_sq, double_tri are defined with dark blue?
    (performs an experiment) ...YES.
    Well, ok but why?..
    -> because of that recursive step: mappers end up seeing how things
        are composed, it's up to us to make sure they *behave* as if they
        only see the colors in their sub-shapes' rendered bitmaps.
    -> ok, so what's the fix?
        ...idunno, but take a look at that thing in prismelrenderer.c which
        says:
            /* TODO: think about this and make sure it's correct */
        ...it's probably not correct, eh.

        UPDATE: It's not correct. I did abstract algebra at it until
        its incorrectness was proven. T__T

WHAT'S NEEDED FOR A PROPER DEMO:

    - Better map.
        - Background/foreground maps.
    - Better camera scrolling.
    - Music + SFX. Almost anything will do for now.
    - Get rid of hexmap "unit": unit starts as (1 0 0 0) and only
        mappers change it.
        Then add a way in the map.fus files to specify mapper cache
        entries, and that's how tilesets with different units can
        co-exist within same worldmap?..
        Not that simple. There are no "vert", "edge" prismels.
        ...although we could add them, I suppose.
        Things get a little annoying, since we have to start adding
        single-"tri" versions of every tile (and player state??),
        and each mapper needs to have solid mappings for prismels
        tri, vert, edge.
        I guess the fus syntax would be:

            shapes:
                "tile1":
                    prismels:
                        # default, one-"tri" version:
                        : "tri" (0 0 0 0) 0 f  2
                        # ...or even have no prismels at all?..
                        # But having one-"tri" versions is maybe nice
                        # for e.g. a minimap
                    mappings:
                        "curvy":
                            # We're now defining the shape which
                            # will be used for map ("curvy") ("tile1")
                            prismels:
                                # etc
                        "double":
                            # ...

    - Title screen. (Maybe allow setting controls, save/load game,
        character select, multiplayer, etc.)
    - Detect player "death", auto respawn them somewhere useful.
        - Bring back "die" state effect?..
        - Can we abuse player->cooldown and have the "jump" state
            trigger death after some amount of time?



Instead of "import" in .fus files, we should maybe add "require", or anyway
    imports should be idempotent.
So all you do is specify worldmap, and it loads rgraphs as required.

hexcollmap "parts":
    - need to realloc collmap1 as necessary for collmap2 to fit.
        and/or need '.' to affect boundary.
    - maybe below "parts" and "collmap" we can have a "draw" section where
        we specify collmap filenames and coordinates.
        It can reuse existing hexcollmap_draw.
        The coordinates can use int_fancy.
        We can add a "randint" thing to int_fancy.
        And then we will have Wilderness.
