- reload + renderall crashes!
    run valgrind, maybe it will find something
    ...nope, it's happening in SDL dynamic lib somewhere...
- fus_lexer: Leaving closing quote off a string literal doesn't seem
    to cause an issue?..
    (With the console input of main_sdl.c)

- review uses of RLE
    RLEDestFormat - we keep running into undefined reads of these...
    Specifically as a result of SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface...
    Look at SDL source, figure out wtf is going on

    Theory: we can recreate the bug by creating a surface, blitting it onto
    something else, then creating a texture from it.
        ...nope, didn't work :|

- prismelrenderer_parse.c:
    fus_lexer_get_{prismel,rendergraph,mapper} shouldn't take a "name" param?
    Maybe reintroduce the *_map objects?
    No: introduce "variable" objects.
    They don't own their shape/prismel/mapper, and the latter don't have names.
    ^... YES THIS

hexmap_submap_t: if these don't share collmaps, just modify collmaps'
    ox, oy instead of messing around with submap's pos?..

COLLMAP INDICES NEED TO USE SAME Y COORDS AS TRF_T
    (currently they are vertically flipped and it ruins everything)

### prismelmappers whose rgraphs have n_frames > 1 ###

It seems obvious that the resulting n_frames should be the product of mapper & mappee shapes.
...we could make it an attribute of prismelmapper: how to treat animation.
    Options:
        - mapper's animation happens once per frame of mappee's animation
        - mappee's animation happens once per frame of mapper's animation
        - mapper + mappee animate simultaneously  <-- this is the default, cos its easiest?..
...ah, but "mapper" is not a rendergraph, it's a mapper.
We could define mapper's n_frames as the LCD of its rendergraphs' n_frames.


Standardize all fus_lexer stuff to leave lexer looking at NEXT UNPARSED TOKEN.
