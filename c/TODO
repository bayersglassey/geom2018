We need:
    - function for rendering a rendergraph to one of its bitmaps (DONE)
    - function to get or render one of a rendergraph's bitmaps (DONE)

Test app:
    - load data/test.fus (DONE)
    - user can choose rendergraph with PgUp/PdDn (DONE)
    - user can rotate/flip/zoom (DONE)

TODO:
    - mapping_t object maps prismels to rendergraphs
    - applying it to a rendergraph generates a new rendergraph
    - add parser support
    - add "curvy" transformation to test.fus

- reload + renderall crashes!
    run valgrind, maybe it will find something
- add: rendergraph_get_or_create_texture()
    that may solve the reload+renderall crash
    (maybe we're just creating too many textures)
